        "In this hands-on, you will get introduced to the world of MRI reconstruction, ranging from conventional reconstruction techniques to machine learning solutions. We start with examining the raw k-space data and coil-sensitivity maps and build the multi-coil forward and adjoint operator. In accelerated imaging, the k-space is undersampled leading to an ill-posed problem. To solve this linear inverse problem, the reconstruction is often regularized. First, we solve the linear and a regularized reconstruction problem conventionally, which allows us to deeply understand where we can later connect to machine learning. These regularizations can also later be learned by neural networks. Machine learning reconstructions thereby differ in their input and targeted application: Image enhancement, direct mapping, physics-based unrolling and distribution-based methods. We will shortly touch upon image enhancement and physics-based unrolling and highlight key factors for development here."

This extended field of view in read-out direction, also termed frequency-encoding direction is actually for free, i.e. does not cost any additional acquisition time, and is acquired per default on MRI scanners. Assuming the base resolution is 320, the number of frequency encoding steps is (at least) doubled. This frequency oversampling results in an increased field-of-view in this direction.

However, in order to proceed to an integration with data consistency, we need to consider the complex-valued nature of the MR data. The complex-valued data can be handled in the network either as real-valued operations (2-channel real-valued) or as complex-valued operations. We will examine the difference between them.\n",

Since MNIST are real-valued images, a phase is simulated and added to the images to generate a complex-valued input. A white Gaussian noise is simulated retrospectively and added to the data.
